Droop is a  web application where users can produce and view collaboratively created drawings. After navigating to the canvas page, users will be prompted with a canvas and a few words describing what they should draw. The canvas may be initially blank, or contain drawings created by other users. When finished, the user will submit their work. When a drawing is deemed complete, it will be featured in our gallery where users can view drawings collaboratively created by the Droop community. 

Droop is created using Django and AngularJS. It is not yet in production however those wishing to test it out may do so by downloading or cloning our git repository. First make sure Django and python 2.7 are properly installed. Then use a terminal to navigate to the droopproject directory and run the command "python manage.py runserver". This will start a local development server. Now the app can be viewed by navigating to the localhost route specified by the local server. Have fun!
